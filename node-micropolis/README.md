## Economy

Above all things in Earth there is Adam. :raised_hands:

Adam is the God of Capitalism. :money_with_wings:

He invents a new currency, and call it ADAM. Presumptuous.

ADAM has a fixed supply of 1T tokens. That's the universe total wealth.

But Adam is good, all mighty. He creates people. And donates 100B ADAMs to them.

But people has nowhere to live. They are looking for cities.

Here comes Frank the Founder.

Frank is a visionaire. He want to found a city.

But Frank has no money to build it. So he prays for Adam to have some.

Adam is good. But not frivolous.

He can sell some ADAM to Frank, in exchange for his Soul.

But Adam is also a Capitalist, so he also accepts USD.

Frank now has some ADAM to spend.

He finds a piece of land, buys it and establishes a new city.

20,000 ADAMs is deposited in the cities budget.

Frank starts to build the city.

If you build people will come.

Whatever he builds he pays the people in ADAMs.

Every year the city collects taxes. The people pays back ADAMs to the city.

Eventually Frank can withdraw some ADAM from the city to his account.
