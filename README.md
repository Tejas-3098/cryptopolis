# Cryptopolis

Cryptopolis brings back the original city simulator that started it all in 1989 to the crypto era. Build a city using the same game engine but with real economics.

SimCity was launched back in 1989 developed by the legendary game designer Will Write. In 2008, the engine C code was ported to C++ and released as free software under the GPL-3.0-or-later license, renamed to Micropolis for trademark reasons.

This project was developed for the [ETHOnline 2023](https://ethglobal.com/events/ethonline2023/) event and the first [Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/) Experiment Week. Here is the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_Xq0s_CqR8bfzQD77MLC0m9lVUvZA1ueloEbXzcr1gU/edit?usp=sharing) of the presentation video below.

## How it works

Cryptopolis uses the exact same C++ engine of [Micropolis](https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis), the open source version of SimCity Classic.

The first step was to build the engine to the RISC-V target architecture, so it can run inside a [Cartesi Machine](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-machine/). The code builds successfully unmodified. One small addition to the original code was minimalist [Node.js binding](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) for the engine, so it could be used by a Node.js application.

The second step was to developed a Node.js application that uses the engine to run the game simulation as a [Cartesi Rollups](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/) application. That also includes implementing an integration of the game economy with a ERC-20 token bridged from Ethereum.

The third step was to implement a new Web UI for the game, using a myriad of libraries, like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [viem](https://viem.sh), [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh), [urql](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql), [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com), [D3](https://d3js.org), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev), and others. The UI includes screens for bridging ERC-20 from Ethereum to power the game economy.

## Game Economy

The original game has a fairly complex simulation logic, but a quite simple economy. A game starts with a budget of say `$20,000`. The player then spends money to build zones, power plants, roads, and other structures. Existing infrastructure also requires resources to keep everything in good condition. Once an year the city collects taxes from the population.

The game economy is powered by a Ethereum ERC-20 token, any token, chosen by the application deployer. Preferrably a fixed supply token.

The first step to play the game is to bridge tokens from Ethereum into the L2 wallet of the game. Building a new city requires `20000` tokens. Currently a player can have only one city at a time.

When the player builds a new city, the application transfers `20000` tokens from his wallet to a special `in-game` wallet (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001`), which matches the game simulations funds.

When the player make city expenses, like building new structures, or just paying for maintenance, funds are transferred from the `in-game` wallet to another special `people` wallet (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002`). This is like the city hiring its people to do the work.

Once every "game year" taxes are collected, which now transfer funds from the `people` wallet to the `in-game` wallet.

In a nutshell, if the player does a good job he recovers the initial investment and make some profit. If the player does a bad job, he will lose money and eventually go bankrupt.

If the `people` wallet runs out of funds, the global economy is in trouble. The game will stop working and the player will not be able to play anymore. However the application deployer can be in control of a token supply and donate more token to the `people`, which can be seen as a World Bank providing humanitarian support.

### Hackathon Achievements

For this hackathon, we used LAOS Network to tokenize the game state on Polkadot, allowing users to build their city and then sell or transfer it to another party. This enables players to profit from the work they've done in-game and the amazing city they built.

As Sui is growing in the gaming industry, we also minted the game state as an NFT on Sui by writing a smart contract in Move. This was extremely complex, as we had to create a robust contract that could handle the unique requirements of game state data and ensure secure transactions.

Together, these technologies enabled us to create a seamless experience for trading game states as NFTs, allowing players to continue gameplay from the exact point where another left off.

In building the Cryptopolis project, we utilized key technologies from both Polkadot and Sui, two of our sponsors, which made the project uniquely possible.

### Polkadot

We leveraged the LAOS Network on Polkadot to mint the game state as an NFT. This involves uploading the metadata of the game state to IPFS using Pinata, and then minting the NFT on the LAOS Network, which supports bridgeless minting. This NFT can be listed on OpenSea, allowing other gamers to purchase it and continue the game from the state in which they bought it. The LAOS Network's seamless integration with IPFS and support for bridgeless minting were crucial features that enabled this functionality.

### Sui

We also minted the game state into a Sui NFT by writing a smart contract in Move, Sui's programming language. This involved creating a robust contract that could handle the unique requirements of game state data and ensure secure transactions. Sui's focus on scalability and performance, along with its support for the Move language, provided a reliable and efficient platform for this part of the project.

## Subprojects

-   micropolis: the original C++ game engine + Node.js binding
-   dapp: a Cartesi Rollups application in TypeScript
-   web: the game UI as a Next.js application

## Building

-   Building the game engine

The command below will build the C++ engine and the Node.js binding targeted to the host machine where it's executed.

```shell
cd micropolis
pnpm i
yalc publish
```

A RISC-V build can be done using Docker and its RISC-V emulation support through QEMU.

-   Building the dapp

```shell
cd dapp
yalc update
pnpm i
pnpm run build
```

Use Node 20.x. Node 22.x is not supported yet.

-   Building the web UI

The UI is a Next.js application, and can be built with the command below:

```shell
cd web
pnpm i
pnpm run build
```

## Running

### Running the dapp

Running on the host:

```shell
cartesi run --no-backend
cd dapp
ts-node src/index.ts
```

Running in the Cartesi Machine:

```shell
cartesi build
cartesi run
```

### Running the web UI

```shell
cd web
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

### Create a game

-   Go to http://localhost:3000/
-   Connect to Metamask wallet
-   Import foundry wallet to Metamask (private key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80)
-   Approve and deposit 20000 tokens
-   Go to http://localhost:3000/play/0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
-   Choose a map and create a game

### Load a game

-   Go to http://localhost:3000/play/0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
-   You can see 2 tabs, New City and Load City. Click on the Load City tab
-   In the Save State field, enter the saved state information (numbers separated by a comma) that are stored as the NFT's attributes
-   The game will then load from the exact saved state and you can continue building the city

## Future Improvements

1. Create a Battle Option for Cities to fight against other cities and steal their resources.
2. Implement other features the game engine supports (Disasters, Budget, Photos, etc.).
3. Work on improving the game latency for a better UX.
4. Implement a revenue model for the game to be profitable to operate and maintain.
5. Look more into lower latency networks for deployment.

## Thanks
